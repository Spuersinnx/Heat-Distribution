# Heat-Distribution
This program follows the static heat equation to determine heat dissipation within a defined area, i.e. a room.

## How it works

1. The program will prompt the user for the size of the room N x N
2. The program will then prompt the user for the number of iterations to be taken into account, as the program calculates heat dissipation within the room
3. The program will then calculate the temperatures
4. The program will then output the initial and then the final temperatures within the room
